 The Census data set was cleaned manually, and extracted using importData.py

 There is 1 python file for every type of learning algorithim used: 
 
- Decison tree
- Boosted
- NN
- KNN
- SVM


At the begining of every file there is an import statement for the dataset and some configurations where to save data. You can uncomment whatever dataset you would like to use.
